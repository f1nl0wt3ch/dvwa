## Troubleshooting
- **Failed to get D-Bus connection: Operation not permitted** replace /usr/bin/systemctl with [systemctl.py](https://github.com/gdraheim/docker-systemctl-replacement/blob/master/files/docker/systemctl.py) and run **RUN chmod a+x /usr/bin/systemctl** 
- **ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock' (2)** server wasn't not yet started. Use **systemctl start mariadb** to start server.
- **Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name** 
```bash
sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Insert the following line at the httpd.conf: ServerName localhost:80
```
