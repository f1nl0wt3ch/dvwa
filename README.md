## Configuration

- **docker build -t f1nl0wt3ch/dvwa-on-centos7:v1 -f Dockerfile .** build an image and give it a name as **dvwa** and version as **v1** from Dockerfile. If you don't want to cache the build, please add more argument like this **--no-cache=true**.
- **docker images** check if the image was created or not by listing all images locally.
- **docker run --name f1nl0wt3ch -p 1234:80 -t -i f1nl0wt3ch/dvwa-on-centos7:v1** run a container from the image.
- **docker exec -it f1nl0wt3ch /bin/bash** enter the container.

## Troubleshooting
- **/usr/bin/systemctl: line 4: from: command not found** install these packages **yum install -y systemd initscripts**
- **Failed to get D-Bus connection: Operation not permitted** replace /usr/bin/systemctl with [systemctl.py](https://github.com/gdraheim/docker-systemctl-replacement/blob/master/files/docker/systemctl.py) and run **RUN chmod a+x /usr/bin/systemctl** 
- **ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock' (2)** server wasn't not yet started. Use **systemctl start mariadb** to start server.
- **Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name** 
```bash
sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Insert the following line at the httpd.conf: ServerName localhost:80
```
- **Could not connect to the database service. Please check the config file. Database Error #2003: Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1' (111).** this means database service wasn't started. Access to the container **docker start <CONTAINER-ID> && docker exec -it <CONTAINER-ID> bash** in case the container is stopped and execute **sudo systemctl restart mariadb**.
